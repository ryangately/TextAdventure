// INTRO
$$INTRO
SONG OF THE DEEP
A text adventure
By Ryan Gately
...
Type help for a list of commands.

...
You wake up to the gentle flickering of light from a lantern. Your body is
wet and aches all over. The cold stone floor stings your palms as you push
yourself up. The air smells of salt and metal.

As you begin ringing the water out of the ragged remains of your clothing, a
small object clatters onto the cold floor. You pick it up and look it over
to discover that it's a compass. You slip it back into your pocket.

You start to look around with only the lantern's flame to show the way.

// ROOM 0
$$0
The room is rectangular, each of the four walls of pale stone is inlaid 
with faint patterns. There are two wooden doors on adjoining walls, one to 
the north and one to the east, each with a large brass ring for a handle.

The patterns are set into the wall, some so shallow that they've almost
faded entirely. The shapes are fluid, curving into one another endlessly.
You can't tell whether or not they've formed naturally.

Then your fingertips trace over angled shapes. There are words written
into the stone...

What is dead may never die.
