$$INTRO
SONG OF THE DEEP
A text adventure
By Ryan Gately
...
Type help for a list of commands.

...
You wake up to the gentle flickering of light from a lantern. Your body is
wet and aches all over. The cold stone floor stings your palms as you push
yourself up. The air smells of salt and metal.

As you begin ringing the water out of the ragged remains of your clothing, a
small object clatters onto the cold floor. You pick it up and look it over
to discover that it's a compass. You slip it back into your pocket.

You begin to look around with only the lantern's flame to show the way.

// ROOM 0

The room is rectangular, each of the four walls of pale stone is inlaid with 
faint patterns. There are two wooden doors on adjoining walls, one to the 
north and one to the east, each with a large brass ring for a handle.

The patterns are set into the wall, some so shallow that they've almost faded 
entirely. The shapes are fluid, curving into one another endlessly. You can't 
tell whether or not they've formed naturally.

Then your fingertips trace over angled shapes. There are words written into 
the stone...

What is dead may never die.
##

@@0door
The wood the doors are carved from is old, worn, and has begun to petrify.
Your fingers glide over the surface easily. The years have worn away any
roughness it once had. The brass handles are secured with a second ring set
into the door.

// ROOM 1
$$1
Coming out of a short passage from the west, the elements take hold. There is 
wind and rain and cold. You are surrounded by great pillars and walls of 
stone, standing at least fifty feet. There are wide steps leading down, where 
the sea crashes against stone and the howling wind flings the rain in all 
directions.

The hull of a boat knocks against the rocks below, tied to a sharp rock by
rope. Beyond it the waves rise and fall in an endless fit, giving brief
glimpses of jagged rock that would make travel perilous, if not impossible.

@@1pillars
The stone pillars are enormous, their width is probably ten feet. There are
hints of markings on the surface, but the elements have removed all of them
except for a few traces on the back side.

The pillars, the steps, the markings -- all of it is too significant to be 
anything less than a temple.

@@1boat
The small ship appears to be in good enough condition to sail, if only the 
storm would let up and the rocks would recede. There is some spare rope tied
to the mast.
##

@@1rope
The rope that anchors the boat is heavy and strong. It has managed to hold
the boat in place for this long, at least. There is more on the boat, some 
light enough to carry.
